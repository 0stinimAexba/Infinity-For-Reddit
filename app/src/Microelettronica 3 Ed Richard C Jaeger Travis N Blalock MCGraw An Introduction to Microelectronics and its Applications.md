Microelectronic Circuit Design is a textbook by Richard C. Jaeger and Travis N. Blalock that covers the fundamentals and applications of analog and digital circuits. The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts of electronic devices and circuits; Part II focuses on analog circuit design, including amplifiers, filters, oscillators, and power supplies; Part III covers digital circuit design, such as logic gates, flip-flops, counters, registers, and memory; and Part IV explores integrated circuit design, fabrication, and testing.
 
The book is designed for undergraduate and graduate students who want to learn the principles and techniques of modern electronic circuit design. It is also suitable for professionals who need to refresh or update their knowledge of microelectronics. The book features numerous examples, exercises, problems, and case studies that illustrate the practical aspects of circuit design. The book also provides online resources, such as simulation tools, lecture slides, and solutions manual.
