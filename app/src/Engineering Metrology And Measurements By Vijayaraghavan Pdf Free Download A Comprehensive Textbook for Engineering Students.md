One of the popular books on engineering metrology and measurements is written by G.K. Vijayaraghavan, R. Rajappan and M. Marimuthu. This book is designed for the fifth semester mechanical engineering students of Anna University, as per the latest syllabus prescribed by the university. The book covers the topics of linear and angular measurements, comparators, screw and gear measurements, surface finish and form measurements, laser and optical measurements, machine tool metrology, coordinate measuring machine (CMM) and computer aided inspection, as well as the measurement of force, torque, power, flow, temperature and pressure. The book also includes a chapter on nanometrology, which is an emerging field of metrology that deals with the measurement of nanoscale objects and phenomena.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise style, with illustrative examples, solved numerical problems, practice problems, review questions and multiple choice questions. The book also provides references to relevant standards and codes of practice for metrology. The book is suitable for both students and practicing engineers who want to learn the fundamentals and applications of engineering metrology and measurements.
 
The book is available in PDF format for free download from various online sources. However, it is recommended to buy the original hard copy of the book from the publishers or authorized dealers to support the authors and get the best quality of the book.
 
Some of the benefits of engineering metrology and measurements are:
 
- They help to ensure the conformity and compatibility of engineering products and processes with the specifications and requirements.
- They help to improve the efficiency and productivity of engineering operations by reducing wastage, rework and defects.
- They help to enhance the reliability and performance of engineering systems and components by detecting and preventing faults and failures.
- They help to support the innovation and development of new engineering technologies and solutions by providing accurate and reliable data and feedback.
- They help to maintain the quality and safety of engineering products and services by complying with the standards and regulations.

Some of the challenges of engineering metrology and measurements are:

- They require high levels of precision and accuracy, which may be difficult to achieve in some situations and environments.
- They involve complex and sophisticated instruments and methods, which may be costly and time-consuming to use and maintain.
- They depend on various factors and conditions, such as temperature, humidity, vibration, noise, etc., which may affect the measurement results and introduce errors and uncertainties.
- They need to adapt to the changing needs and demands of engineering applications, such as new materials, new designs, new standards, etc., which may require new or improved measurement techniques and tools.
- They face ethical and social issues, such as privacy, security, trust, etc., which may limit or restrict the access and use of measurement data and information.
